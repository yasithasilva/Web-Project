<h2>CROPLIFE INTERNATIONAL</h2> 
<p>CropLife International has trained over 4 million farmers in effective agricultural techniques since 2005, 
    helping to enhance crop yields and revenue while reducing poverty.
     Here's an example of a project in Honduras that's working to bring 108,000 rural Hondurans out of poverty, in collaboration with USAID. 
     These training activities aid in the definition of best practices, which are then replicated by the training activities of our member companies, 
     which reached over 20 million farmers in 2018.</p>
