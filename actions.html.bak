  <p> The fight against global poverty can be a discouraging one. The number of people suffering is hard to imagine for most middle-class families.
      While there is a multitude of poverty-stricken individuals, things are not entirely bleak.Poverty rates have been raising in recent years
	  because of the pandemic.But as people, we can make a difference in this fight with the right approach.With the right policy choices, we can 
	  move the needle on poverty, expand the middle class, and put the economy on an upward trajectory.</p>
