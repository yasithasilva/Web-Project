<h1> <center> <b> Take Actions to End Poverty </b> </center> </h1>

  <p> The fight against global poverty can be a discouraging one. The number of people suffering is hard to imagine.
      While there is a multitude of poverty-stricken individuals, things are not entirely bleak.Poverty rates have been raising in recent years
	  because of the pandemic and many other reasons. 
	  the COVID-19 pandemic could increase global poverty by as much as half a billion people,  or 8% of the total human population. In April 2020,
	  the United Nations issued <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/un_framework_report_on_covid-19.pdf" target="_blank"> framework
	  for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19</a> and created the Secretary-General's UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. 
	  Before the pandemic, significant progress had been made in alleviating poverty in many countries within Eastern and Southeastern Asia,
	  but up to 42 per cent of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa continued to live below the poverty line.
	  As people, we can make a difference in this fight with the right approach.With the right policy choices, we can 
	  move the needle on poverty, expand the middle class, and put the economy on an upward trajectory.
	  Work is a major route for many to escape poverty. However, working alone does not guarantee this, particularly if working conditions are not decent. 
      In 2019, more than 630 million workers worldwide — almost one in five of all those employed — did not earn enough to lift themselves and their 
      families out of extreme or moderate poverty. </p>

  <p> The UN has defined 7 Targets and 14 Indicators for SDG 1 ,Poverty. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
      to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets. The targets were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a
	  universal call to action to end poverty,  and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy development and prosperity.

<h1> <center> <b> The Targets </b> </center> </h1>

<br>

<h3> Target 1.1: <b> Eradicate extreme poverty </b> </h3>

<p> <i> UN definition: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.</i></p>


<br>

<h4> SDG INDICATOR 1.1.1 <h4>

<p> <b> Eradicate extreme poverty </b> </p>

<p>Definition: Indicator 1.1.1 is the proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical
 location (urban/rural).</p>
 
 
<p>This poverty line is measured in "international dollars" which are a hypothetical currency that adjusts for price differences between countries 
(purchasing power parity) and it is measured in prices of 2011 to adjust for price changes over time (inflation).</p>

<p><b>Goal</b> By 2030 eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.</p>
