<h1> <center> <b> Take Actions to End Poverty </b> </center> </h1>
<br>
  <p> The fight against global poverty can be a discouraging one. The number of people suffering is hard to imagine for most middle-class families.
      While there is a multitude of poverty-stricken individuals, things are not entirely bleak.Poverty rates have been raising in recent years
	  because of the pandemic.But as people, we can make a difference in this fight with the right approach.With the right policy choices, we can 
	  move the needle on poverty, expand the middle class, and put the economy on an upward trajectory.
	  Work is a major route for many to escape poverty. However, working alone does not guarantee this, particularly if working conditions are not decent. 
      In 2019, more than 630 million workers worldwide — almost one in five of all those employed — did not earn enough to lift themselves and their 
      families out of extreme or moderate poverty. </p>

  <p> The UN has defined 7 Targets and 14 Indicators for SDG 1. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
      to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.</p>
